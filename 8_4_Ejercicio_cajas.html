    <h1 id="h1">The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>
The <span id="italic"class="inline">cottage garden</span> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.
</p>
<p>
The Cottage Garden originated in <span class="inline">England</span> and itr history can be traced back centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <span class="inline">English estate gardens</span>.
</p>
<p>
The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendantes, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
